  Accepts 0 or more objects as arguments, and returns a single object
  with subsequent objects merged.  Each subsequent objectâ€™s key/value
  pairs are added to the preceding object.  This function is used
  to combine multiple objects into one.  You can think of this as
  the first object being the base object, and each subsequent argument
  being overrides that are applied to the base object.
examples:
- context: None
  args: [{"a": "b"}, {"c": "d"}]
  returns: {"a": "b", "c": "d"}
- context: None
  args: [{"a": "b"}, {"a": "override"}]
  returns: {"a": "override"}
- context: None
  args: [{"a": "x", "b": "y"}, {"b": "override", "c": "z"}]
  returns: {"a": "x", "b": "override", "c": "z"}
